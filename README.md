## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I got an idea of how to make background image responsive. The trick is Use the background-size property to encompass the viewport. Give this property a cover value that will tell a browser to scale the background image’s heights and width so that they always remain equal to or greater than the height/width of the device viewport.
 

### Continued development
In my future projects, I will take this learning to design layout of website keeping responsiveness in mind. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn Code Online](https://web.learncodeonline.in/) - This helped me in learning fundamentals of CSS and media queries.
- [CSS udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) - This helped in learning HTML5 semantic markup, various CSS properties, in writing clean code, adding comments, structing folder etc.
